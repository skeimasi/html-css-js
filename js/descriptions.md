## 1. Remove Duplicate Characters

> Given a string, remove all duplicate characters and return a new string containing only unique characters while maintaining their original order. This function is case-sensitive and preserves the first occurrence of each character.\

## 2. Find Missing Number

> Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], find and return the only number in the range that is missing from the array. The function uses the mathematical formula for the sum of first n natural numbers to efficiently find the missing number.\

## 3. Find Indices of Two Numbers that Sum to Target

>Given an array of integers nums and a target integer, find and return the indices of two numbers in the array that add up to the target. The function uses a hash map for O(n) time complexity and assumes exactly one solution exists. Returns an empty array if no solution is found.\

## 4. Two Sum Description

> Given an array of integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, this function finds two numbers in the array that add up to the target. It returns an array of the indices of these two numbers.
> The function uses a hash map to store previously seen numbers and their indices. For each number, it calculates the complement (target - current number) and checks if this complement exists in the map. If found, it returns the indices of both numbers. If no solution is found, it returns an empty array.\
